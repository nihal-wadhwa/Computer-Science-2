<div align='center'> <h1> Labs </h1>

This folder contains all the labs assigned by my professor to assess our knowledge of the material presented that week. 
  
These were longer, more complex projects with more details and functionalities to implement. 
 
Each folder describes a different assignment for a different topic and will display the description as well as the grade of the project. The purpose of this is to be show transparency of both my strengths and shortcomings across each assignment.

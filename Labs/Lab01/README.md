<div align='center'> <h1> Lab 1: Introduction </h1>

### Description:
  
These folders each contain a mini program that serves as a way to introduce me to Java by implementing some basic functions. These include implementing a java version of the turtle module in Python, a hashing function, testing the installation of JavaFX, and a couple of programs to test the primality of numbers.
 
No output shown as there are a lot of files... navigate to each folder and run as you please.

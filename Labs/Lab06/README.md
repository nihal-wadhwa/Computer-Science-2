<div align='center'> <h1> Lab 6: Networked Concentration Game </h1>

### Description:
  
This project builds a networked concentration game using the knowledge gathered in the Networking in Java lecture that week. In order to run this project, you must first run the server, then run the client, in order to establish a steady connection between the two entities and have the game play out correctly. 
  
The server runnables are located in the server folder (ConcentrationServer.java OR ConcentrationMultiServer) and the client runnable is ConcentrationClient.java, located in the client folder.
